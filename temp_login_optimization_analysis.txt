Analysis of Public/js/login.js for optimization:

1. DOM Element Caching:
   - Currently, many DOM elements are cached at the top level, which is good.
   - However, inside validateSignupForm and handleLoginSubmit, handleSignupSubmit, there are repeated document.getElementById calls for form inputs. These can be cached once during init or setupEventListeners to reduce DOM queries.

2. Event Listeners:
   - Event listeners are added individually to elements like authTabs, toggle-password buttons, and forms.
   - Consider event delegation for authTabs and toggle-password if the DOM structure allows.
   - The passwordInput and confirmPasswordInput listeners are fine.

3. Form Validation:
   - validateSignupForm calls document.getElementById multiple times for each input.
   - Could cache these inputs once and reuse their values.

4. Password Strength and Match:
   - checkPasswordStrength uses 'this.value' and is called with call(passwordInput) or call({value: password}).
   - Could be refactored to accept password as parameter for clarity.
   - passwordHints are cached, which is good.

5. Async Functions:
   - handleLoginSubmit and handleSignupSubmit have good error handling.
   - The fetch URLs use relative paths, which is good for deployment flexibility.

6. UI Updates:
   - showAlert and clearAlerts are well implemented.
   - renderView, showAuthView, showProfileView are clear and concise.

7. Misc:
   - Some optional chaining is used (e.g., signupForm?.reset()), which is good.
   - The code is modular and readable.

Optimization Plan:

- Cache all form input elements once during init or setupEventListeners.
- Refactor validateSignupForm to use cached inputs.
- Refactor handleLoginSubmit and handleSignupSubmit to use cached inputs.
- Refactor checkPasswordStrength to accept password as parameter instead of relying on 'this'.
- Consider event delegation for authTabs and toggle-password toggles if feasible.
- Minor code style improvements for clarity and consistency.

No changes to functionality, only performance and readability improvements.
